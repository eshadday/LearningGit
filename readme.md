# Git Example
This is a project for practicing git.

# What is Git? 
Git is a version control software, that keeps track of our software/code. It maintains the history and changes of our project. We can also have numerous versions of our code simultaneously. 

# initializing a Git repository
Starting our git repo, to begin maintaining our project's version history.

# Git commit
A commit is a checkpoint that represents and holds our code at that point in our project's history. We can always revert back to a previous comit to undo any changes. Usually used to store a significant change in our project.

# Git and Github
Keep in mind that Git and Github are different things. Git = a version control software that can be used on your computer, certain text editors/ides and it's what github uses behind the scenes to maintain your code. Github is a remote service that holds your Git repos. 

# Git branches
A branch is a separate version of our code, made from a commit on a different branch (usually the main/master branch). Changes on branches don't effect any other branches in our git repo, they are independent changes. We can merge changes into our branches when we want those changes all in one branch.
