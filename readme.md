# What is Git? 
Git is a version control software, that keeps track of our software/code. It maintains the history and changes of our project. We can also have numerous versions of our code simultaneously. 

# initializing a Git repository
Starting our git repo, to begin maintaining our project's version history.

# Git commit
A commit is a checkpoint that represents and holds our code at that point in our project's history. We can always revert back to a previous comit to undo any changes. Usually used to store a significant change in our project.

# Git and Github
